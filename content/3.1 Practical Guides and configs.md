## 3.1.1 Installing Linux
There are [[2.3 System Considerations|many different Linux distributions]], which all come with advantages and disadvantages. There is not really a blanket solution for which system you should chose. However, the best way to get into it is to just start, and learn along the way. 

For this guide we recommend installing [DietPi](https://dietpi.com/). Originally developed as an operating system for the Raspberry Pi, it now supports most Single Board Computers, as well as native PCs. It's very light-weight, meaning that it doesn't take much space and doesn't use a lot of resources like processing power and RAM, ensuring that it will run fine even on slower machines. If you prefer to use another Linux ditribution feel free to skip this part of the tutorial.

### 3.1.1a Installing DietPi

> ℹ️ Most of this manual is taken from the official [DietPi Install Guide](https://dietpi.com/docs/install/).

In order to install DietPi you need a few things:

1. A **working computer** with internet access (from which to prepare the install)
2. An *empty or overwriteable* USB drive of minimum 2GB capacity
3. A [[2.2 Hardware Considerations|target computer]] on which you want to install DietPi

#### Downloading DietPi (SBC)
There are [many variations](https://dietpi.com/) of DietPi available on the official website, depending on what kind of machine you are planning to install it on. There are versions for most common Single Board Computers, which is one of the main advantages of DietPi. If you are using an SBC, find the apropriate version of DietPi and download it. and proceed to the next step

#### Dowloading DietPi for a native (non-SBC) PC
If you plan to install DietPi on a *regular* computer like an old laptop, you first need to find out whether it's BIOS based or UEFI based. It's not really important to understand what this means in order to continue, it's just about downloading the correct installer.

Basically, if your computer is newer, chances are bigger that it's UEFI based. The older it is, the more likely it's BIOS based. The newer it is, the more likely it's running UEFI. If it runs Windows 11, you are running UEFI for sure since it doesn't support BIOS.

If the computer you want to use is running an older version of Windows, you can check which one your computer is running by pressing `⊞ Win` + `R` to open the Windows Run dialog, type `msinfo32`, and then press `Enter` to open System Infomation window. Find the entry `BIOS mode`. If it's set to `UEFI` you are using UEFI, if it's set to `Legacy` you are using BIOS.

If you are already running Linux, the easiest way to find out if you are running UEFI or BIOS is to check for a folder called /sys/firmware/efi, for example with the command `ls /sys/firmware/efi`. If you are using BIOS, the folder will be missing. If the folder exists, you are running UEFI.

Once you know whether your computer is UEFI based or BIOS based, download the corresponding version from the [official website](https://dietpi.com/) to your **working computer**.

#### Extracting the image
The file you downloaded in one of the previous steps is packaged in a 7z archive, which you need to extract first. Functionally, this is similar to a .zip or .rar file. You might need to download additional software in order to extract the archive.

If your **working computer** runs Windows you can use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). If your **working computer** runs macOS you can use [The Unarchiver](https://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html). 

If your **working computer** runs Linux you can use p7zip, the command line version of 7-Zip. On Debian and Ubuntu-based systems, you can simply open a terminal and type:

```
$ sudo apt install p7zip
```

Once p7zip is installed, navigate to the downloaded file and type the following to extract it:

```
$ 7zr x PUTYOURFILENAMEHERE
```

Replace **PUTYOURFILENAMEHERE** with the correct name of the downloaded archive, e.g. **DietPi_RPi-ARMv6-Bullseye.7z**. This will extract the DietPi image file for you to use.

After all of this you should be left with an *image file*. If you don't know what this means, just make sure you have a file that ends with .iso.

#### Flashing the Image
We now want to take this image file, and put it on a flash drive like a USB stick or SD card, which we can then use to install Linux. This process is called *flashing*. ~~There are several tools to do this, however the easiest is probably [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), which is free and available for Windows, macOS and Linux.~~

~~It's pretty straight foward: after downloading balenaEtcher to your **working computer**, plug your flash drive into the same working computer and open balenaEtcher.~~

~~Select `Flash from File`, then locate the installer image you extracted in the previous step (it should be a .iso file). Then select your flash drive as a target and click `Flash!`~~
