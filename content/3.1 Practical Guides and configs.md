## 3.1.1 Installing Linux
There are [[2.3 System Considerations|many different Linux distributions]], which all come with advantages and disadvantages. There is not really a blanket solution for which system you should chose. However, the best way to get into it is to just start, and learn along the way. 

For this guide we recommend installing [DietPi](https://dietpi.com/). Originally developed as an operating system for the Raspberry Pi, it now supports most Single Board Computers, as well as native PCs. It's very light-weight, meaning that it doesn't take much space and doesn't use a lot of resources like processing power and RAM, ensuring that it will run fine even on slower machines. If you prefer to use another Linux ditribution feel free to skip this part of the tutorial.
