# 2-1 Preparation and what to expect

If you are thinking about setting up your own server to begin hosting some of your digital infrastructure, there are a few things to consider and plan for.

Firstly, depending on your current level of expertise, you might have to prepare to take in a whole bunch of information, and learn (a lot of) new things about computers. While you don't really need to know or learn programming itself, becoming a system administrator, or sysadmin for short, probably involves learning how to install and use Linux operating systems, and using computers without [[0-2_glossary_of_terms#Graphical user interfaces, shells, consoles, and terminals| graphical user interfaces]]. These text based interfaces (command lines) can often seem scary and confusing to new users, but as is the case with many things in this guide, after a bit of practice you will probably get used to it. This guide includes a small introduction to the command line, and there are many articles on the internet that give beginners an introduction for how to interact with their computers through text based interfaces (see [[0-2_glossary_of_terms#Graphical user interfaces, shells, consoles, and terminals|Graphical user interfaces, shells, consoles, and terminals]] for more information).

As previously mentioned, the main expense that comes with self-hosting is that time that it requires. After the initial setup, it will be necessary to maintain the server (update the system and software, swap out hardware, etc.) periodically. Sometimes things might stop working for some reason. It will be up to you to figure out why that is and what you can do to fix it. Especially when setting up a service that is shared by others, you should prepare for the eventuality of people writing you with their issues, sometimes at inconvienient times.

Don't start by hosting your work email if you need it every day.
