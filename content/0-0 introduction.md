So, you've heard about self-hosting. Or maybe you have come to realize that you want to opt out of the [[0-2_glossary_of_terms#Cloud|cloud]] but are not exactly sure where to start. Or maybe someone sent you this website in order to convince you that you should.

Maybe you're approaching this topic as an individual, or maybe you represent a small group or collective with similar ideas. Maybe you're looking for some recommendations for [[0-2_glossary_of_terms#docker|docker]] images—or maybe you have no idea what that means.
