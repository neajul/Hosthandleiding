# Welcome

So, you've heard about self-hosting. Or maybe you have come to realize that you want to opt out of the [[0-2_glossary_of_terms#Cloud|cloud]] but are not exactly sure where to start. Or maybe someone sent you this website in order to convince you that you should.

Maybe you're approaching this topic as an individual, or maybe you represent a small group or collective with similar ideas. Maybe you're looking for some recommendations for [[0-2_glossary_of_terms#docker|docker]] imagesâ€”or maybe you have no idea what that means.

This publication aims to pick you up wherever it is that you are right now, and to point you in a direction where you can continue your journey towards self-hosting.

>**TL;DR**
>Today, we use more and more cloud services in our daily lives. These are often run by software companies with questionable ethical integrity. They often lock us in walled gardens and limit our agency as users. Our internet and technology usage has devastating consequences for the environment.
>Self-hosting can be a more ethical approach to digital infrastructure in your personal or professional life. Most cloud services can be replaced with consumer hardware, such as an old laptop that is set up as a server. It requires some technical know-how, but most of the information is freely available and much can be learned along the way.

> In computing, a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients".

When we talk about self-hosting we mean accessing a computer (the physical device), having the ability to install and run whatever software you want on it, and to make that software and it's functionality availble to **yourself**, and or others via the internet. 

Your server can function as a web-server for your personal website. You may also install software that allows you to use it as file sever to store, access and perhaps even edit files collaboratively. 

There are various reasons why you might be considering to host your own online services. Maybe you don't trust big tech. Maybe you are concerned about your digital footprint. Maybe you are just interested in learning something new. Whatever the reason, self-hosting gives you full control over your files and how you bring them online.
