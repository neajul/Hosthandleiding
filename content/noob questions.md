# whats unclear about homebrewserverclub
- homebrew server club doesn't go over command-line basics at all
	- they link to floss manuals, pretty obscure link not sure why they do this
	- might be worth explaining
		- what a command-line, terminal, shells, bash/zsh etc are
		- a little about the history of linux, and its different distributions
- homebrew assumes that I am sudo
	- I personally don't even use my computer from the admin user which means i first have to log in but i guess nobody does that
	- either way some form of intro to command-line and its terminology would be pretty helpful
		- not having to leave the wiki to scavange for prerequisites would be ideal
- they also don't show you how to install linux
- the illustrations are floating around the content, headlines are moving around
