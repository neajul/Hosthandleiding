## Booting

**Booting** is what happens when a [computer](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") starts. This happens when the power is turned on. It is called "reboot" if it happens at other times. When you boot a computer, your [processor](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor "Processor") looks for instructions in system [ROM](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROM "ROM") (the [BIOS](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS "BIOS")) and executes them. They normally 'wake up' [peripheral equipment](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_equipment "Peripheral equipment") and search for the [boot device](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_device "Boot device"). The [boot device](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_device "Boot device") either loads the [operating system](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") or gets it from someplace else.

## CPU (Central Processing Unit)

A central processing unit (CPU) is an important part of every computer. The CPU sends signals to control the other parts of the computer, almost like how a brain controls a body

## ARM

ARM architecture is a computer CPU architecture used in computers of all sizes up to supercomputers; commonly used in embedded systems and mobile devices such as cell phones, tablet computers, and handheld game consoles such as the Game Boy Advance. 

ARM CPUs use very little electricity and produce very little heat. Most ARM CPUs run on battery power and don't need a cooling fan. The Linux operating system is used most on ARM CPUs.

## x86

x86 is a term used to describe a CPU instruction set compatible with the Intel 8086 and its successors, including the Pentium and others made by Intel and other companies. This is the CPU architecture used in most desktop and laptop computers. Many 21st century workstations and servers also use x86 processors.

## SBC (Single Board Computer)

A **single-board computer** (**SBC**) is a complete [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") built on a single [circuit board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_board "Circuit board"), with [microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor")(s), [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory "Random-access memory"), [input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output "Input/output") (I/O) and other features required of a functional computer. Single-board computers are commonly made as demonstration or development systems, for educational systems, or for use as [embedded computer controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system "Embedded system").

## File Systems

A File system (or filesystem) is a way of storing all data on a data storage device. The data is usually organized in computer files in directories. Below the file system there is usually a physical device where the files are stored. 

This might be a hard disk, USB flash drive, compact disc, or DVD. The file system might also talk to a remote server over a network where the file is stored. The file system might also only use RAM to store the files.

## Kernel

A **kernel** is the central part of an operating system. It manages the operations of the computer and the [hardware](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware "Computer hardware"), most notably memory and [CPU](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU "CPU") time.  Kernels also provide services which programs can use through system calls.

### Linux

**Linux** or **GNU/Linux** is a [Unix-like](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") [operating system](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") (or family of) for computers. An operating system is a collection of the basic instructions that manage the [electronic](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics") parts of the computer allowing running applications and programs. 

The [Linux kernel](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel") (the basis of the operating system) is [free software](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Free software"), meaning everyone has the freedom to use it, see how it works, change it, or share it.

## Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a free operating system that uses the Linux kernel. The word "ubuntu" is an African word meaning "humanity to others". It is pronounced "oo-boon-too".

It is one of the most popular Linux distributions and it is based on Debian Linux computer operating system. 

## Debian

**Debian** is a free [operating system](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system"). It is a distribution of an operating system known as the [GNU operating system](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU "GNU"), which can be used with various kernels, including [Linux](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel"), [kFreeBSD](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD "FreeBSD"), and [Hurd](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd "GNU Hurd"). In combination with these kernels, the operating system can be referred to as Debian GNU/Linux, Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, and Debian GNU/Hurd, respectively. Debian GNU/Linux is one of the most complete and popular [GNU/Linux distributions](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux"), on which many others, like [Ubuntu](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu "Ubuntu"), are based.

## GNU (GNU's Not Unix)

**GNU** is the name of a [computer](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") [operating system](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system"). The name is short for _**G**NU's **N**ot **U**nix_. [Richard Stallman](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman "Richard Stallman") leads the GNU Project. The popular [Linux](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux") operating systems made using the [Linux kernel](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel") have many GNU tools too. So, many projects and [developers](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer "Software developer") call the Linux-based operating systems _[GNU/Linux](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux "GNU/Linux")._

The GNU project was started by Richard Stallman in [1983](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983 "1983"). He wanted to create a computer system that was all [free and open-source software](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "Free and open-source software"). Users could change, share and publish new work based on GNU. He and a group of developers started by creating copies of each piece of [UNIX](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX "UNIX") software. The rest of GNU was the [kernel](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science) "Kernel (computer science)"), called the [GNU Hurd](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd "GNU Hurd"), which is not yet finished. The more popular [Linux kernel](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel") is often used instead.

## DietPi

DietPi is an extremely lightweight Debian-based OS. It is highly optimised for minimal CPU and RAM resource usage, ensuring your SBC always runs at its maximum potential.

## Docker (software)

**Docker** is a technology that bundles a software program with all of the other software that application needs to run, such as an operating system, third-party software libraries, etc. Software bundled like this is called a **container**.

The benefit of using Docker to put applications in containers is that they can be run on different kinds of computers (for example, both a laptop and a web server), without the risk of a missing software library or a different operating system causing the application to not work.

# Graphical user interfaces, shells, consoles, and terminals

[Computers](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) can display information and let the user give commands to it using two methods: a [command line interface](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interface "Command line interface") (CLI) or a [graphical user interface](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface") (GUI).

In a command line interface, the user types commands using the [keyboard](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_(computer) "Keyboard (computer)") to tell the computer to take an action. For example, the **more** command available in most operating systems will display the contents of a file. Sometimes people call CLI “Console”, but consoles can be GUI, too

## Shell

An [operating system](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") **shell** is a user interface that enables the user to interact with and access the services offered by the operating system. The user gives commands to the operating system through its shell.

There are various types of shells:

- **C**ommand **L**ine shells the user types commands at the prompt.
- Menu driven shells: the user selects commands from menus.
- Graphical User Interface shells: the user selects  graphical menus and icons.

Examples of command line operating systems are UNIX and Disk Operating System (DOS). Examples of menu driven operating systems are the DOS shell. Finally, examples of graphical user interface (GUI) operating system are Linux and Microsoft Windows. 

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

A means of interacting with a [computer program](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines).

## Text Terminal

A _text terminal_, or often just _terminal_ (sometimes _text console_) is a serial computer interface for text entry and display. Information is presented as [an array of pre-selected formed characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mode "Text mode"). When such devices use a video display such as a [cathode-ray tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube "Cathode-ray tube"), they are called a "[video display unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_display_unit "Video display unit")" or "visual display unit" (VDU) or "video display terminal" (VDT

The [system console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_console "System console") is often[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#cite_note-17) a text terminal used to operate a computer. Modern computers have a built-in keyboard and display for the console. Some Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD "FreeBSD") have virtual consoles to provide several text terminals on a single computer.

## Sytem Console

One meaning of system console, computer console, root console, operator's console, or simply console is the text entry and display device for system administration messages, particularly those from the BIOS or boot loader, the kernel, from the init system and from the system logger.

It is a physical device consisting of a keyboard and a screen, and traditionally is a text terminal, but may also be a graphical terminal. System consoles are generalized to computer terminals, which are abstracted respectively by virtual consoles and terminal emulators.

## Linux Console

The **Linux console** is a [system console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_console "System console") internal to the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_console#cite_note-1) A system console is the device which receives all kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode.

## Server

In computing, a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the client–server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. 

A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device. Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.

## Cloud

**Cloud computing** is when [computing](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing") services are provided by a [company](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company "Company") or place [outside of where they are being used](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing "Outsourcing"). 

It is like the way in which [electricity is sent to users](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution "Electric power distribution"): they simply use the electricity that is sent to them and do not need to worry where the electricity is from or how it is made and brought to them. Every month, they pay only for what they used and nothing more. The [idea](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea "Idea") behind cloud computing is similar: The user can simply use [storage](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage "Storage"), computing [power](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit"), or [development](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development") environments, without having to worry how they work behind the scenes.

====The _**cloud**_ is a [metaphor](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor "Metaphor") for the [Internet](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") based on how it is described in [computer network](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") diagrams. 

==Just as how in the real world, [clouds](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud "Cloud") hide parts of the [sky](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky "Sky") from [sight](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight "Sight"), the _cloud_ in computing hides the complex [infrastructure](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure "Infrastructure") that makes the Internet work.

It is a type of computing in which [IT-related](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology "Information technology") actions are provided “[as a service](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_as_a_service "Everything as a service")”, allowing users to access these services through the Internet ("in the _cloud_").

They do not have to know or control the [technologies](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology") behind them, preventing them from running into [ethical](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics") and [legal](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law") problems.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

Software as a service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. SaaS is also known as "on-demand software" and Web-based/Web-hosted software.

## Web hosting service

A **web hosting service** is a type of Internet hosting service. It allows people and [companies](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company "Company") to make their [website](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website "Website") available on the [World Wide Web](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web"). 

Web hosts are companies which provide space on a [server](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)") which is owned or [leased](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lease "Lease") for use by clients. These clients store their [Web site](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_site "Web site") on the server. The server feeds the [web pages](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page "Web page") to the [Internet](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").

## Domain name

A **domain name** is a human-readable [web address](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL "URL") (e.g. "google.com") that points to an [IP address](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address") and helps users to access websites or other resources in a convenient way. 

Domain names have extensions (called "top-level domains") at the end of the URL. For example ".com", ".net" and ".org" are the most commonly used domain name extensions.[[1]](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name#cite_note-1) The most popular domain extension is .com with more than 100 million domains registered.[[2]](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name#cite_note-2) The .com extension stands for "commercial", .org for organization and .net for network.

There are also country-specific domain name extensions. For example, the [United Kingdom](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") has the ".uk" domain extension and [Japan](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") has ".jp".

## IP address

An **IP address** (short for **Internet Protocol address**) is a label which is used to identify one or more devices on a [computer network](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), such as the [internet](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). It can be compared to a postal address. An IP address is a long [number](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number") written in [binary](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number "Binary number"). 

Since such numbers are difficult to communicate, IP addresses are usually written as a set of numbers in a given order. Devices using IP addresses use the [internet protocol](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") to communicate.

## Production Ready

When we refer to an environment being production-ready we mean. That the server and the software that you installed on it runs, is backed-up, stable, maintainable and that it satisfies the needs for whatever you are making on a daily basis.
