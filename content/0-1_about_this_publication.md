# 0-1 About the Self Hosting Manual

This publication aims to give individuals and small groups and collectives an entry point to start self-hosting (parts of) their digital infrastructure. The first version has been developed as a part of the *Artsformation* program, and funded by Waag NL in Amsterdam.

The publication has been inspired by squatting manuals, texts that have codified and politicized the process of squatting since the 1970s, and that have been openly available to all that are interested. The authors of this publication think that setting up your own server is a political act, and no so unlike the action of squatting a house to live and work in.

The goal of this publication is to make self-hosting, a topic that comes with several technical hurdles, accessible to a more general public and beginners, while still being  a useful resource to more advanced readers. No prerequisites are required from the reader.
