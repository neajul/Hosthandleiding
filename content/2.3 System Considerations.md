# System considerations

- What is Linux and why are we using it?
- What are cool distributions
- Headless vs. GUI
	- what is a commandline?





- We recommend DietPi
	- community, super light weight, straight forward
	- while we recommend working with [[0.2 Glossary of Terms#Docker (software)|docker]] it comes with a lot of scripts for [[0.2 Glossary of Terms#On the Metal|on-the-metal]] installs
	- works for most [[0.2 Glossary of Terms#SBC (Single Board Computer)|SBCs]]
	- as well as old windows computers
	- we wrote [[3.1 Practical Guides and configs#3.1.1a Installing DietPi|guide]] for it
- There are many other systems that can make sense, depending on preference and situation
	- We recommend Alpine Linux
	- For advanced users. Since this manual is targeted at beginners to intermediates we don't include a guide for now
- Installing Linux on mac
