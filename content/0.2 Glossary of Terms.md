## Server

In [net jargon](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_jargon "Net jargon"), a **server** is a [computer](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") that serves many kinds of information to a [user](https://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/user "wikt:user") or [client](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client "Client") machine. 

Usually a server will only do a few things for many clients. Every type of thing a server does is called a service. Services are used by other computers that are called clients. The relationship between client and server is called a [client-server](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-server "Client-server") relationship. 

For example, [Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia "Wikipedia") has [web](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website "Website") servers which have a service for sending web pages over the Internet. Your client computer talks to Wikipedia's web page service to get web pages for you. A server can also host [internet games](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game "Video game"), [share files](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_server "File server"), and give access to [peripheral equipment](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_equipment "Peripheral equipment") such as printers. 

==In simple words, the individual computers are connected to some powerful computers called servers. These store files and information in the form of website. With an Internet connection, different users anywhere in the world can access these files.==


## Cloud

**Cloud computing** is when [computing](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing") services are provided by a [company](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company "Company") or place [outside of where they are being used](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing "Outsourcing"). 

It is like the way in which [electricity is sent to users](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution "Electric power distribution"): they simply use the electricity that is sent to them and do not need to worry where the electricity is from or how it is made and brought to them. Every month, they pay only for what they used and nothing more. The [idea](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea "Idea") behind cloud computing is similar: The user can simply use [storage](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage "Storage"), computing [power](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit"), or [development](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development") environments, without having to worry how they work behind the scenes.

====The _**cloud**_ is a [metaphor](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor "Metaphor") for the [Internet](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") based on how it is described in [computer network](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") diagrams. 

==Just as how in the real world, [clouds](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud "Cloud") hide parts of the [sky](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky "Sky") from [sight](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight "Sight"), the _cloud_ in computing hides the complex [infrastructure](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure "Infrastructure") that makes the Internet work.

It is a type of computing in which [IT-related](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology "Information technology") actions are provided “[as a service](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_as_a_service "Everything as a service")”, allowing users to access these services through the Internet ("in the _cloud_").

They do not have to know or control the [technologies](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology") behind them, preventing them from running into [ethical](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics") and [legal](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law") problems.


## Domain name

A **domain name** is a human-readable [web address](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL "URL") (e.g. "google.com") that points to an [IP address](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address") and helps users to access websites or other resources in a convenient way. 

Domain names have extensions (called "top-level domains") at the end of the URL. For example ".com", ".net" and ".org" are the most commonly used domain name extensions.[[1]](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name#cite_note-1) The most popular domain extension is .com with more than 100 million domains registered.[[2]](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name#cite_note-2) The .com extension stands for "commercial", .org for organization and .net for network.

There are also country-specific domain name extensions. For example, the [United Kingdom](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") has the ".uk" domain extension and [Japan](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") has ".jp".


## IP address

An **IP address** (short for **Internet Protocol address**) is a label which is used to identify one or more devices on a [computer network](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), such as the [internet](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). It can be compared to a postal address. An IP address is a long [number](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number") written in [binary](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number "Binary number"). 

Since such numbers are difficult to communicate, IP addresses are usually written as a set of numbers in a given order. Devices using IP addresses use the [internet protocol](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") to communicate.

%%The [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority "Internet Assigned Numbers Authority") assigns IP addresses to [regional internet registries](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_internet_registry "Regional internet registry") (RIRs). The RIRs assign them to [Internet Service Providers](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider "Internet service provider"). Internet Service Providers then assign IP addresses to their customers. Very often, people have a router or gateway at home, to which they connect computers, printers, and other devices. These routers or gateways are often configured to assign "local" IP addresses to the devices that are connected.

Each address has two parts: one that specifies the computer or group of computers, and another which specifies the [network](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"). A device can have more than one IP address. Certain types of IP addresses are used to address a group of devices, while others are used to address only one device. Certain types of addresses are unique, others can be re-used. A number of IP addresses are used for special purposes, for example to obtain an IP address automatically.

An IP address is converted to physical or [Media Access Control Address](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address "MAC address") using the [Address Resolution Protocol](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol "Address Resolution Protocol") (ARP). If an IP address is your phone number, then your MAC address is your name. You may change your phone number, but your name will not change.%%


## (Self) Hosting

## Web hosting service

A **web hosting service** is a type of Internet hosting service. It allows people and [companies](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company "Company") to make their [website](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website "Website") available on the [World Wide Web](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web"). 

Web hosts are companies which provide space on a [server](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)") which is owned or [leased](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lease "Lease") for use by clients. These clients store their [Web site](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_site "Web site") on the server. The server feeds the [web pages](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page "Web page") to the [Internet](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").

%%[Wikia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikia "Wikia"), for example, is a hosting service. Many web hosting companies also provide other services including [file hosting service](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_hosting_service "File hosting service").%%


## Docker (software)

**Docker** is a technology that bundles a software program with all of the other software that application needs to run, such as an operating system, third-party software libraries, etc. Software bundled like this is called a **container**.

The benefit of using Docker to put applications in containers is that they can be run on different kinds of computers (for example, both a laptop and a web server), without the risk of a missing software library or a different operating system causing the application to not work.

## VPN

A **virtual private network**, or **VPN** is a set of [technologies](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology") which are used to link computers to create a private network. Another network is used to carry the data, which is [encrypted](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption "Encryption"). The carrier network will see the packets of data which it routes. To the users of the VPN, it will look like the computers were directly connected to each other.

The VPN model can guarantee the following:

-   [Confidentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality "w:Confidentiality"): The carrier network will route the data, but it will be unable to decrypt it.
-   Sender [authentication](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication"): People need to authenticate themselves, to be able to use the network.
-   Message [integrity](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity "Data integrity"): Messages transported across the network cannot be changed easily while they are in transport. When a message was changed, it is possible to detect this.

In a business context, VPNs are often used to connect different office locations, or to allow people working from outside the company network to access its resources. People can use their computer to connect to their work network and see work [websites](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website "Website") that cannot be seen on the normal internet.[_[source?](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_]

Similarly, the encryption process allows VPNs to offer [anonymity](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity "Anonymity") by hiding the user and making it very hard for anyone to track them. As a result, VPNs help make one's online activities on the web anonymous and undecipherable.

VPNs are often used to access websites that are blocked in some countries, like [China](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China").[[1]](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network#cite_note-1) Many people also use a VPN to protect their internet activity while using public WiFi.

%%VPNs can also be used to connect corporate offices to the larger branch offices, also known as site-to-site VPN. This is because direct network connections are impractical between offices that are physically distant. Common VPN protocols include [OpenVPN](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN "OpenVPN"), [Cisco](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cisco&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cisco (not yet started)") AnyConnect, and [IPsec](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec "IPsec").%%

## Shell

An [operating system](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") **shell** is a user interface that enables the user to interact with and access the services offered by the operating system. The user gives commands to the operating system through its shell.

There are various types of shells:

- Command line shells: the user types commands at the prompt.
- Menu driven shells: the user selects commands from menus.
- Graphical user interface shells: the user selects  graphical menus and icons.

Examples of command line operating systems are UNIX and Disk Operating System (DOS). Examples of menu driven operating systems are the DOS shell. Finally, examples of graphical user interface (GUI) operating system are Linux and Microsoft Windows. 

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

A means of interacting with a [computer program](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines).

| Command  | Action |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `ls` | List the normal files and folders in the current directory in condensed format  |
| `pwd`  | Output the full path of the current working directory for this terminal |
| `cd`  | Change your current working directory. When used by itself, it will default to changing to your home directory |
| `cd [FOLDER]` | Change your current working directory to the desired [FOLDER] |
| `cd ..` | Change your current working directory to the parent directory |



## Kernel

A **kernel** is the central part of an operating system. It manages the operations of the computer and the [hardware](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware "Computer hardware"), most notably memory and [CPU](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU "CPU") time.  Kernels also provide services which programs can use through system calls.

### Linux

**Linux** or **GNU/Linux** is a [Unix-like](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") [operating system](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") (or family of) for computers. An operating system is a collection of the basic instructions that manage the [electronic](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics") parts of the computer allowing running applications and programs. The [Linux kernel](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel") (the basis of the operating system) is [free software](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Free software"), meaning everyone has the freedom to use it, see how it works, change it, or share it.
