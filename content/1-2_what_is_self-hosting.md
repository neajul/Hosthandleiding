# 1-2 What is self-hosting

At this point, it's probably good to explain what a [[0-2_glossary_of_terms#Server|server]] is in a few words. In very simple terms, it is a computer that *serves* information to a user (or *client*) machine. The resulting relationship is often called a *server-client relationship*.

When you visit a website, somewhere in the world there is a computer that has the website stored on itâ€”the *server*. When you enter the URL into your browser, you are being connected to this computer, and it will send you back (*serve* you) the content of the website, which is then displayed in your browser.

Similarly, if you edit a Google Docs file with someone else, somewhere in the world there is a computer that has the content of this document saved on it. Every time you make a change, it's sent to this server, which then sends (*serves*) the changes you just made to all the other users in real time, making sure everyone is always in sync and that everyone can see what the other people are up to.

When people say the cloud is just someone else's computer, this is what they mean: the cloud is a bunch of servers that keep everyone connected. In the case of big tech, these servers are part of huge data centers, incredibly complex operations that exist in specifically designed buildings that use the energy equivalent of small cities. This scale is necessary because these companies serve millions of people simultaneously, all over the world, who expect things to happen immediately and without a moment of delay. 

If the cloud is someone else's computer, self-hosting is moving it to your own computer. At least theoretically, any computer can function as a server and while it requires some technical expertise, time and effort, it's possible to set up a small server in your own home or work place that can replace a large part of these commercial cloud services in your workflow. Since you most likely don't need to serve millions of people at the same time, the requirements for this can be surprisingly low. If you want to supply file sharing, collaborative writing, video calling and a shared calendar for yourself and the people in your surroundings, chances are that an old laptop that you or someone you have lying around would be up to the task.









If the cloud is just someone else's computer, self hosting is saying why does it have to be someone else's computer, why can it not be my own computer.
- ethically there are a lot of advantages, as we have control over what, how, when where
- the trade off is effort: self hosting means doing a lot of things that, in the cloud, others do for us for free

Nothing is perfect: permacomputing, computing in gernal is not sustainable from an ecological point of view. But it could be (slightly) betterl

## 1-2-1 What are the benefits of self-hosting?

As previously discussed, self-hosting comes with a set of ethical and practical advantages.

- It allows people to gain (more) control over their data, both in terms of privacy and access to their files
- It allows them to become more self sufficient in their digital infrastructure
- It lets them build systems that can adapt and develop along with their needs while simultaneously enabling them to plan for longevity
- It often allows to build systems that are more closely adapted to their specific needs
- In the process, users will learn a lot about the way servers and digital infrastructures work, making them more adapt at avoiding mistakes and fixing problems
- It allows users to minimize their ecological foot print through lower energy usage and the recylcing of old hardware
- It makes them less dependent on companies that are [[1-1_problems_with_the_cloud#1-1-2 Why is that a problem?|diametrically opposed to their ethical values]].

## 1-2-2 What are the challenges of self-hosting?

But while 



- it's a lot of work
- maintenance!
- probably need a dedicated person to use this in production (though not full time)

**it's important to recognize that this only seems laborious because the expense of these processes is intentionally hidden from us behind the smooth user interfaces of cloud services!**
- Working in the cloud is expensive (electricity, bandwidth, maintenance)
- Big corporations only make things seem frictionless
- This has warped out perception of what a seemless experience is
