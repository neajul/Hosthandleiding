# 1.2 What is self hosting
If the cloud is just someone else's computer, self hosting is saying why does it have to be someone else's computer, why can it not be my own computer.
- ethically there are a lot of advantages, as we have control over what, how, when where
- the trade off is effort: self hosting means doing a lot of things that, in the cloud, others do for us for free

Nothing is perfect: permacomputing, computing in gernal is not sustainable from an ecological point of view. But it could be (slightly) better

## 1.2.1 What are the benefits of Self Hosting?
- privacy
- some companies chose self hsoting over AWS etc, why?

## 1.2.2. What are the challenges of Self Hosting?
- it's a lot of work
- maintenance!
- probably need a dedicated person to use this in production (though not full time)

**it's important to recognize that this only seems laborious because the expense of these processes is intentionally hidden from us behind the smooth user interfaces of cloud services!**
- Working in the cloud is expensive (electricity, bandwidth, maintenance)
- Big corporations only make things seem frictionless
- This has warped out perception of what a seemless experience is
