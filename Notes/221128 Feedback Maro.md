I think that you are shaping a great resource in making the manual; I enjoyed reading it. I am thankful for the commission and also for what this can mean for the world.  
  
From general consideration, the content suddenly gets very technical, and you can focus on that, but most people will use and read the beginning: understanding what servers are, what is the problem with corporate servers, and that it is possible to use alternatives.   
  
Since the technical details are long, changing, and specific from case to case, I would print only the first sections and general instructions with the QR to the digital, full version that can be updated. What do you think?

I am interested in publishing parts of the manual in other open-source tools with proper credit. Would you be ok with this?  
  
Thanks for the hard work, and keep sending me material you need feedback on
