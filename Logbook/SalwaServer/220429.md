Met with Ada and Leila today. We decided that for storage we will go with an HC4 and two drives, which will be configured as a NAS. Leila will have a crack at this, which is a good way for her to get used to the command line etc. I will buy them soon.

We spend the day doing some pretty basic docker practice with her. Kinda wholesome day lol.
