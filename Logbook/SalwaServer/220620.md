I recently found out about [Permacomputing](http://permacomputing.net/Principles/), a small manifesto about ethical computing developed by some people (among other places?) in Rotterdam. I really like this and it also ties in directly with the whole tree/seeding thing. I like a lot: Build on solid ground/grow roots on solid ground.
