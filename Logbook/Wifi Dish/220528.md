Today I will start setting up the Raspberry Pi 3B to act as a DHCP server and forward internet traffic to other devices. This time I am installing Raspbian Lite, which has no desktop environment, in the hope that it will be slightly faster. I used Raspberry Pi imager for this. As a user name I set:

```
u: kraken
p: gaatdoor
```

Now the first thing to do is to install the driver for the wifi module, because it seems that it delivers a stronger signal than the pi itself. For this I follow this guide: https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au

The install went fine, but I am not actually sure if it works, since the pi comes with a wifi antenna already lol

I will now try to set up that the pi takes internet and forwards it through the ethernet port, using this giude: https://www.elementzonline.com/blog/sharing-or-bridging-internet-to-ethernet-from-wifi-raspberry-pI

This didn't work at all, however I found this script which does it all in one go super chill! https://willhaley.com/blog/raspberry-pi-wifi-ethernet-bridge/ It worked immediately :)
