Today I will work on making Cloudia-o nomadic. Basically, while the server is in the design department at the Sandberg it's trapped behind the router. Without administrator access to the network, we cannot host from within the network. This is why we will direct all traffic through the pub server through ssh. This actually started out as a small lesson in ssh keys. I will generate a public key pair for my raspberry pi and the pub server. For this i mainly follow the [hombrewserver.club tutorial](https://homebrewserver.club/demystifying-ssh.html) for this, with one exception. Following [this tutorial](https://linuxhint.com/setup_ssh_without_passwords/), I use the `ssh-copy-id` command to copy my public key into the remote server.

``` bash
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
# I left the password empty here
$ sudo nano $HOME/.ssh/config
# add something like: 
# Host si
#  Hostname pub.sandberg.nl
#  User kraken
#  Port 22229
#  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
$ ssh-copy-id si
```

This now lets me log into the pub server with `ssh si` without having to enter a password, which will make everything a lot easier, and lets me automate things. Also, this can be a bit confusing, but the `si` in all ssh commands from now on is just shorthand for `kraken@pub.sandberg.nl`, not some obscure flag.

This now lets us set up ssh port forwarding with one simple command:

``` bash
$ ssh -fNR 18443:localhost:443 si &
```

This will forward all traffic from the pub server on port 18443 to port 443 on our machine, which is of course where our webserver is listening. To test if this works, I will now change the IP address in the DNS records for the domain I bought to the pub server. But then: it turns out the user account Jan Kees made for me on the pub server doesn't have privileges to edit the apache configs. So I cannot really continue, and will instead do something else.

Instead, I decided to check out how to install an ftp server. I saw that there is a Filezilla image on linuxserver.io, though I am still unsure whether I would be able to use this in a similar way. It was really straight forward to set up though, and I even learned something. The `docker-compose.yml` file looks like this atm:

```yaml
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  filezilla:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/filezilla:latest
    container_name: filezilla
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Amsterdam
    volumes:
      - /var/apps/filezilla:/config
    ports:
      - 4000:3000
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - theStack
networks:
  theStack:
    external: yes
```

I bound it to port 4000 on the outside for now, since 3000 is already occupied. What's crazy though is that in the nginx config file I use port 3000, not 4000! Even though that port is occupied already. I don't understand it but it's cool. I think this will work with vscode as well...

```
server {
    server_name ftp.*;

    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl; # managed by Certbot

    include /config/nginx/ssl.conf;
    client_max_body_size 0;

    error_log /var/log/nginx/pad.sandberginstitute.design-error.log;
    location / {
        include /config/nginx/proxy.conf;
        resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s;
        set $upstream_app filezilla;
        set $upstream_port 3000;
        set $upstream_proto http;
        proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port;
    }
}
```

I decided to delete Filezilla again. I didn't like the interface, so even if I could get it to work to upload things I didn't want to use it, and will try to focus on something else instead. I did however install vscode:

``` yaml
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  openvscode-server:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/openvscode-server:latest
    container_name: openvscode-server
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Amsterdam
#      - CONNECTION_TOKEN= #optional
#      - CONNECTION_SECRET= #optional
      - SUDO_PASSWORD=Decolonize!
#      - SUDO_PASSWORD_HASH= #optional
    volumes:
      - /path/to/appdata/config:/config
      - /:/root
    ports:
      - 3500:3000
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - theStack
networks:
  theStack:
    external: yes
```

I exposed the root directory to this, which is why I set up a token. We can access this by adding &tkn=(and then the token) to the url the first time we visit.
