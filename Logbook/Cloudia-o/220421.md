Today, we met for the first time. We discussed what the server will need to be able to do, and what we need to achieve it. We decided that it will mainly be a web server: both to host things like the yearbook website, as well as an etherpad instance for the department.

We also will need an external backup solution. We will need to talk to the department about that, or maybe Jan Kees.

Additionally we thought it would be cool to set up FTP access. This way the students in the department can share warez, and upload videos. Videos for what?

There will be a screen connected to the server, which students can use to play videos at all times :)

We started writing an origin story for the server (Cloudia-o) as well. more details can be found [here](https://cloud0.192168285.xyz/index.php/s/QWcDbYDmPQ4JLYm).
