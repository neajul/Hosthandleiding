Today I will actually start to set the server up, during the graduation show I was mostly concerned with aesthetics. First I begin with installing docker. Some time during the graduation show I reinstalled the system because something wasn't working, so I begin with a basically untouched system, despite that we begin by updating and upgrading everything. Docker is not part of apt package manager, but there is an easy install script for Raspbian which I found [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/docker-on-raspberry-pi). We also need to add our current user (that's what we want to run docker from) to the docker group, otherwise we can only run docker commands as sudo, and then reboot.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
$ sudo sh get-docker.sh
# then we add our user to the docker group
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
$ sudo reboot
```

We also need to install docker-compose. I found a guide for this [here](https://pumpingco.de/blog/setup-your-raspberry-pi-for-docker-and-docker-compose/): 

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev
$ sudo apt install python3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
$ sudo pip3 install docker-compose
```

The idea is to first set up the server running properly from my house and, once it works, route all traffic through the pub server. So for now I set up port forwarding in my house to forward all 80 and 443 traffic to the pi (and 22 for good measure). Then I start by setting up docker. I want docker to start on boot, and then create a docker network in which I can run multiple services

```bash
#start docker on boot, and start it now
$ sudo systemctl enable docker
$ sudo systemctl start docker
#create the network the Stack, where we will install all of our files to
$ docker network create theStack
```

The first package we install is SWAG, it sets up a reverse proxy service. Basically, this will direct traffic to all our docker containers, while protecting them from the outside (only port 80 and 443 will be visible to the outside!). In order to do this, we go to https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag, and save the docker compose file in a loacation where we want to save our apps. I created the directory apps/theStack in the user folder, where I also plan to save other docker files. We make the necessary changes in the compose file, for reference mine looks like this:

```yaml
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  swag:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag:latest
    container_name: swag
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Amsterdam
      - URL=192168285.xyz
      - VALIDATION=http
      - SUBDOMAINS=www, #optional
      - CERTPROVIDER= #optional
      - DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare #optional
      - PROPAGATION= #optional
#     - DUCKDNSTOKEN= #optional
      - EMAIL= #optional
      - ONLY_SUBDOMAINS=false #optional
      - EXTRA_DOMAINS= #optional
      - STAGING=false #optional
    volumes:
      - /var/apps/swag:/config
    ports:
      - 443:443
      - 80:80 #optional
    restart: unless-stopped
```

The we run docker-compose. After we watch the logs and wait for the server to declare it's ready.

```bash
$ nano docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker logs swag -f
```

This works! I can now navigate to my domain (which I pointed towards my own IP address before) and get a message that the SWAG server is configured! SWAG even automatically sets up https :)

I found an etherpad docker setup [here](https://github.com/nsnw/etherpad-docker-compose). I edited the docker-compose file to fit our settings (which was mainly changing the network to theStack):

```yaml
version: '3'

services:

  db:
    restart: always
    image: "postgres:10"
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=etherpad
      - POSTGRES_USER=etherpad
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme
    networks:
      - theStack
  etherpad:
    hostname: etherpad
    container_name: etherpad
    build:
      context: .
    ports:
      - 9001:9001
    networks:
      - theStack
networks:
  theStack:
    external: yes
```

This works, if I visit the internal IP address on port 9001 (in this case: http://192.168.2.154:9001), there is a fully functioning version of etherpad. I then configured SWAG. Swag comes with a bunch of example configurations, but not for etherpadm, so I had to include my own:

```
server {
    server_name pad.*;

    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl; # managed by Certbot

    include /config/nginx/ssl.conf;
    client_max_body_size 0;

    error_log /var/log/nginx/etherpad.mydomain.de-error.log;
    location / {
        include /config/nginx/proxy.conf;
        resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s;
        set $upstream_app etherpad;
        set $upstream_port 9001;
        set $upstream_proto http;
        proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port;
    }
}
```

This works almost great, https://pad.192168285.xyz directs to the pad now, only there is a certificate error. This was fixed by changing a line in the docker-compose file of swag:

```yaml
...
      - SUBDOMAINS=www, pad
...
```

This works really well, which is great!
